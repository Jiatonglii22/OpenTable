# OpenTable
A class project completed with a partner that focuses on outlining the beginning stages of creating a database for a company. In our project, we chose OpenTable, a restaurant reservation service. 

To run: 
PostgreSQL needs to be installed 

To initialize the database, type the following (without '%') in the command line: 
% psql -d postgres -U isdb -f initialize.sql

To run individual SQL queries, type python (without '&') followed by the python file name in the command line: 
example: % python complex_query_1.py
